# intro_ds_housing_prices
Final assignment for Coursera [Introduction to Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) course in which we perform hypothesis testing.

The assignment was to take datasets on housing prices, university towns, GDP over time, and write functions to address whether housing prices in university towns were less affected by recessions. Pandas was used to import, clean, and merge data and SciPy was used to run a statistical test.
